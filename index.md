## Professional self-assessment

### Introduction

Throughout my time at SNHU, I've gotten to study many different facets of computer science from the practical to the theoretical, all of which have built upon my existing knowledge of the field. Over the years, I’ve gone from having narrow skill in some parts of software development to being a well-rounded developer and thanks to a combination of the coursework I’ve done and my own studies I can apply that knowledge to solve practical problems using software.

One of my interests over the course of my studies has been AI, as the structure and design of the various components that go into creating things like neural networks and training datasets has always fascinated me. I plan to eventually study this topic more thoroughly and apply my knowledge of programming to possibly development my own business applications using machine learning. Thanks to the extensive learning I’ve undertaken as part of my computer science program, I feel this will now be feasible and easier to accomplish.

In addition to providing me with more advanced knowledge on the various aspects of software development as well as the theoretical aspects of computer science, I also feel after completing my program I am better at learning new concepts, especially when they have to do with software or computer theory. I believe that this is one of the most important takeaways from my degree program, as I am now better equipped to do research on and master topics that peak my interest.

Wrapping up, the development of this ePortfolio has provided me with an opportunity to work in a somewhat open-ended way to produce enhancements on software that I had previously developed as part of my coursework. This experience has been a great learning opportunity in both the practice of developing software and the art of designing and executing on a plan of action, as well as following it through to meet the desired outcomes.

### Collaboration

Throughout our coursework, there were instances where collaborating on projects was not only an invaluable tool to accomplish the task at hand, but a center-point of the leanings involved in some courses. The emphasis that various projects put on collaboration allowed a unique way of learning to effectively work as a team, both through experience and through the material.

Although the development of this ePortfolio was not a collaborative undertaking, the skills I learned in collaborating with team members on various projects throughout my coursework has aided me still. One of the key skills I brushed up on as part of collaborating with my peers was working with continuous integration tools like GitHub, which has been an invaluable tool throughout these projects.

Additionally, the practice of working with my peers has helped me develop good habits when developing software, including sticking to a consistent, readable format as well as making prolific but concise comments to explain the functionality of my code.

### Communication

Along with collaboration comes effective communication. When working with larger projects, this takes many forms from planning as a team to hashing out designs and action plans. Communicating during projects is as a big a part of effective development as communication before the project beings.

One of the most important aspects of software engineering I learned from my coursework was utilizing the commonly accepted models of the software development life-cycle in order to plan and execute development of various projects. It has also helped me better abstract ideas about functionality and design in a way that they can be effectively communicated with my peers as well as those overseeing projects (in the case of coursework, I suppose that would be the instructors).

In addition to communicating ideas, I have also become much more astute when it comes to seeking feedback and incorporating it into my designs in order to development the best final outcomes possible. I feel this is a valuable tool when it comes to communicating with stakeholders, as it provides many opportunities to gain insight into what they’re plans are for their final product, allowing one to better execute on the vision of the overseers of a given project.

### Fundamentals

Over the course of both working on this ePortfolio and my coursework throughout my program in general, I have accumulated much knowledge surrounding the fundamentals of programming such as data structures and algorithm implementation. A solid grasp of these fundamentals has allowed me to pick up more programming languages more easily, as understanding the building blocks of software greatly helps with grasping new syntactical concepts.

Implementing these fundamentals over the course of my program, as well as in a professional setting has allowed me to become accustom to working with them. I have a working knowledge of most basic data structures and how they operate, as well as the steps to take in implementing them into virtually any language. The same case goes for common algorithms, as the abstraction of these concepts into workable ideas has helped me go from a theoretical understanding to being able to make practical implementations.

Similarly, abstracting ideas using behavior graphs, flowcharts, and pseudocode has helped me greatly in comprehension of complex ideas, as well as implementing my own into different languages. I believe this skill is also invaluable for any software developer as it not only allows for one to format complex ideas in a simple format, but allows effective communication of said ideas to others if done properly.

### Working with Data

Along with learning the fundamentals, throughout both my coursework and these projects working with data has been emphasized, as it is one of the most important skills one can have in the industry. Data is the primary asset of many larger firms and organizations, and it is what provides meaningful actionable information that organizations use to make decisions. Without easy access and the ability to manipulate data on demand, the technology sector would be severely stunted.

The materials presented to me throughout my program have equipped me to work with data on a large scale and the artifacts shown in this portfolio demonstrate that aptitude. I feel as thought this is, yet again, an invaluable skill all software engineers should posses as it provides them not only with a means by which they can advance their career, but a method to start their own enterprise. Monetizing data is a booming business model currently and those who have mastered working with it have the opportunity to capitalize on that market.

### Security

Lastly of all the major concepts emphasized by my coursework, as well as these projects, security is one of the cornerstones of software development. Throughout my program, a strong emphasis was put on the importance of utilizing security practices such as defense in depth, redundant security measures, authentication and access control, and secure data management. These concepts are crucial to the longevity of any organization, as security breaches are not only financially devastating, but usually big PR killers.

I feel as though in artifact 2 I have put a particular emphasis on security, as one of the major concepts of my program is that it encrypts data at rest by default, preventing unauthorized reading of classified information. Incorporating these concepts into my designs for software is something I believe is very important, as it not only develops good habits, but creates safe software.

### Artifacts

Finally, I will be discussing the artifacts and how they fit together in my ePortfolio.

Firstly, I have create a WebGL implementation of some previous coursework I did for a computer graphics course using three.js. I created this artifact to demonstrate the ability to take an existing idea or concept, abstract it in such a way that it could be broken down and understood, and then implement said idea into a new format using the now mapped out abstraction. I am a heavy user of post-it notes to organize my thoughts, so I oftentimes write out minimalist design ideas or flowcharts onto post-it notes or pieces of paper. For this artifact, I first took the existing concept I had made for my computer graphics course, broke it down into it’s fundamental components, and figured out how to implement their functionalities into three.js.

Next, for my second artifact I have created an encrypted data storage app in java, utilizing swing as a means to make a graphical interface for said app.  The app works by creating files for each user based on their UID, storing encrypted data in said files via the JSON format and a custom data structure I created (similar to an array with indices, but utilizing JSON objects), and dynamically decrypting and updating said information before re-encrypting it and writing it to the file. It can preform all standard CRUD operations on all user data, which can be controlled by the GUI.

Finally, for my last artifact I have made a REST API in Node.js as a means to expand a simple CRUD module I wrote in python as part of my CS-340 course. I added the functionality for the program to receive requests, preform all standard CRUD operations, dynamically interface with any running instance of MongoDB, and even run on a server if configured properly. It utilizes Express for the server and Mongoose for data manipulation.
