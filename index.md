## Professional self-assessment

### Introduction

Throughout my time at SNHU, I've gotten to study many different facets of computer science from the practical to the theoretical, all of which have built upon my existing knowledge of the field. Over the years, I’ve gone from having narrow skill in some parts of software development to being a well-rounded developer and thanks to a combination of the coursework I’ve done and my own studies I can apply that knowledge to solve practical problems using software.

One of my interests over the course of my studies has been AI, as the structure and design of the various components that go into creating things like neural networks and training datasets has always fascinated me. I plan to eventually study this topic more thoroughly and apply my knowledge of programming to possibly development my own business applications using machine learning. Thanks to the extensive learning I’ve undertaken as part of my computer science program, I feel this will now be feasible and easier to accomplish.

In addition to providing me with more advanced knowledge on the various aspects of software development as well as the theoretical aspects of computer science, I also feel after completing my program I am better at learning new concepts, especially when they have to do with software or computer theory.
