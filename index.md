## Professional self-assessment

### Introduction

Throughout my time at SNHU, I've gotten to study many different facets of computer science from the practical to the theoretical, all of which have built upon my existing knowledge of the field. Over the years, I’ve gone from having narrow skill in some parts of software development to being a well-rounded developer and thanks to a combination of the coursework I’ve done and my own studies I can apply that knowledge to solve practical problems using software.

One of my interests over the course of my studies has been AI, as the structure and design of the various components that go into creating things like neural networks and training datasets has always fascinated me. I plan to eventually study this topic more thoroughly and apply my knowledge of programming to possibly development my own business applications using machine learning. Thanks to the extensive learning I’ve undertaken as part of my computer science program, I feel this will now be feasible and easier to accomplish.

In addition to providing me with more advanced knowledge on the various aspects of software development as well as the theoretical aspects of computer science, I also feel after completing my program I am better at learning new concepts, especially when they have to do with software or computer theory. I believe that this is one of the most important takeaways from my degree program, as I am now better equipped to do research on and master topics that peak my interest.

Wrapping up, the development of this ePortfolio has provided me with an opportunity to work in a somewhat open-ended way to produce enhancements on software that I had previously developed as part of my coursework. This experience has been a great learning opportunity in both the practice of developing software and the art of designing and executing on a plan of action, as well as following it through to meet the desired outcomes.

### Collaboration

Throughout our coursework, there were instances where collaborating on projects was not only an invaluable tool to accomplish the task at hand, but a center-point of the leanings involved in some courses. The emphasis that various projects put on collaboration allowed a unique way of learning to effectively work as a team, both through experience and through the material.

Although the development of this ePortfolio was not a collaborative undertaking, the skills I learned in collaborating with team members on various projects throughout my coursework has aided me still. One of the key skills I brushed up on as part of collaborating with my peers was working with continuous integration tools like GitHub, which has been an invaluable tool throughout these projects.
